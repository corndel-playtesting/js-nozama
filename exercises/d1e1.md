Take a look at
[managing the database](https://tech-docs.corndel.com/express/managing-the-database)

In the `db/migrations` folder, you will find the `.sql` files needed to reset
and seed the database.

In `package.json`, you will find the `db:reset` script. This script will run the
`1-reset.sql` file to drop and recreate the tables.

**Todo**

1. Create a `db.sqlite` file in the `db` folder.

2. Run `npm run db:reset` to create the tables.

3. Create and run a `db:seed` script that will seed the database with the seed
   data.

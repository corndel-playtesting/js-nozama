In `models/User.js` you will find a `User` class. This class contains methods to
interact with the database.

The method `User.findAll` has been implemented already.

**Todo**

1. Run `npm run test:d1e3` to see the failing tests.

2. Implement `User.findById(id)` which returns a single user **object**, found
   by their ID. Test again.

3. Implement `User.findByFirstName(firstName)` which returns an **array** of all
   users whose first name is equal to the `firstName` parameter. All tests
   should now be passing.

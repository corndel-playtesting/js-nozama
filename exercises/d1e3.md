In `models/User.js` you will find a `User` class. This class contains methods to
interact with the database.

The method `User.findAll` has been implemented already.

**Todo**

1. Implement `User.findById(id)` which returns a single user object, found by
   their ID.

2. Implement `User.findByFirstName(firstName)` which returns an array of all
   users whose first name is equal to the `firstName` parameter.
